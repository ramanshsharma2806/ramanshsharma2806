### Latest

I've just finished on a project at [Omdena](https://omdena.com/) in partnership with [TrashOut](https://www.trashout.ngo/) to predict illegal dumpsites occuring all over the world.

These days, I have started to work on my first research paper. Did you know that CNN's are really expensive to train on Google colab ;( If you have experience with implementing U-Net in TensorFlow, please reach out to me :D

### Interests

My primary interests are as follows (not necessarily in this order):

1. Neural Networks.
2. Working on projects using Neural Networks.
3. Hosting awesome events as a [http://deeplearning.ai/](http://deeplearning.ai/) Ambassador.

*Fun fact*: In 2018, I stood at the 4th position in the annual PSAL Boys Badminton Individual Championships - [go here](https://challonge.com/2018PSALBoysSingles/standings).
