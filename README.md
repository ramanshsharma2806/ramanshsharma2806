# Hi there, I am Ram!

### Latest

I'm currrently working on a project at [Omdena](https://omdena.com/) in partnership with [TrashOut](https://www.trashout.ngo/) to predict illegal dumpsites occuring all over the world.

These days, I am learning the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) library used for deep learning (shh! it might be my new favorite, tensorflow can't know yet)

### Interests

My primary interests are as follows (not necessarily in this order):

1. Neural Networks.
2. Justifying the library I am using these days to implement said neural networks.
3. Writing blogs, [my blog](https://ramanshsharma2806.github.io/blog) and [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@ramanshsharma).

*Fun fact*: I pour milk before cereals.
